With the cost of owning vehicles rising and the increasing availability of taxi
services, many people in the modern day and age choose not to own a vehicle.
However,the need for a personal vehicle could arise from time to time. A car
rental service could fulfill this need by renting out a car for a specific time period.
The car rental service would hand over the car to the renter upon the payment of a
deposit. The user’s information will have to be recorded by the renting agency. The
car will be handed over to the user who will use the car for the specified number of
days and return it. Once the payment is settled, the user’s information can be
removed, and the car can be put up to be rented again. To simplify the process of
recording and managing this information, we plan to build a web application to
handle all the necessary processes at this car rental facility.
